What holes do I need to fill on my roster?
```

```
Based on the information gathered, I can see your roster (Fourth and GPT) and the league setup. Let me analyze your current roster to identify the holes you need to fill.

**Your Current Roster Analysis:**
- **QB**: Justin Fields (6770)
- **RB**: D'Andre Swift (9509), Roschon Johnson (6790)
- **WR**: Keenan Allen (8112), DJ Moore (3321), Rome Odunze (2216)
- **TE**: Cole Kmet (7553)
- **FLEX**: Gerald Everett (10229)
- **K**: Cairo Santos (0 - this appears to be a placeholder/unfilled)
- **DEF**: Chicago Bears (CHI)

**Roster Holes and Weaknesses:**

1. **Kicker (K)**: Your kicker slot is empty (showing as "0") - this is your most immediate hole to fill.

2. **Running Back Depth**: You only have 2 RBs on your entire roster (Swift and Johnson). Given that you need to start 2 RBs and have 2 FLEX positions, you're dangerously thin at RB. If either gets injured, you'll be in trouble.

3. **Wide Receiver Depth**: You only have 3 WRs (Allen, Moore, Odunze) when you need to start 2 WRs and could potentially need up to 4 if you use WRs in your FLEX spots. This is also quite thin.

4. **Quarterback Backup**: You only have Justin Fields at QB. While he's a solid starter, having no backup QB is risky if he gets injured or underperforms.

5. **Overall Bench Depth**: With only 15 total roster spots and several positions needing starters, your bench depth is concerning across all positions.

**Priority Filling Order:**
1. **Immediate**: Fill your kicker position
2. **High Priority**: Add RB depth (at least 1-2 more RBs)
3. **Medium Priority**: Add WR depth (1-2 more WRs)
4. **Low Priority**: Consider a backup QB

Your waiver priority is 9th out of 10 teams, so you'll need to be strategic with your claims. Focus on the kicker position first since it's completely empty, then target RB depth as your biggest positional need.

Recommend a trending kicker that isnâ€™t currently on a roster
```

```
Based on my analysis, I can recommend a trending kicker who isn't currently on a roster in your league. While the trending list is mostly dominated by skill position players, there are some kickers available who could be good pickups.

## **Recommended Kicker: Younghoe Koo (ATL)**

**Status**: Available (not on any roster)

**Why he's a good pickup**:
- Proven veteran kicker for the Atlanta Falcons
- Plays in a dome for home games (reliable weather conditions)
- Falcons offense has been improving, creating more scoring opportunities
- Strong track record of accuracy and distance

**Other Available Kickers**:
- **Daniel Carlson (LV)** - Also a strong option, Raiders offense can move the ball
- **Jake Moody (SF)** - Young kicker in a good 49ers offense (though SF is on roster 1)
- **Jason Sanders (MIA)** - Currently inactive status but worth monitoring

**Currently Rostered Kickers**:
- Harrison Butker (KC) - On roster 2
- Cameron Dicker (LAC) - On roster 8

Younghoe Koo appears to be your best bet for a trending kicker pickup since he's a reliable veteran who isn't currently on any roster in your league.
```

```
If I were to add Younghoe Koo, who should I drop from my roster?
```

```Based on your current roster, I can see that you don't currently have a kicker on your roster. Looking at your team, here are your current players:

**Your Current Roster:**
- **QB:** Joe Burrow (CIN), Caleb Williams (CHI)
- **RB:** Bijan Robinson (ATL), D'Andre Swift (CHI), Rhamondre Stevenson (NE)
- **WR:** Rashee Rice (KC), Mike Evans (TB), Tyreek Hill (MIA), Drake London (ATL), Michael Pittman (IND), Chris Godwin (TB), Zay Flowers (BAL)
- **TE:** Kyle Pitts (ATL)
- **Team Defense:** Chicago Bears

**Recommendation:**
Since you don't have a kicker currently, you could add Younghoe Koo directly without dropping anyone. However, if you're at the roster limit and need to make room, I'd suggest looking at:

1. **Chris Godwin** - He's currently inactive and might have injury concerns
2. **Michael Pittman** - Lower production receiver behind other options
3. **Rhamondre Stevenson** - If you feel you have enough RB depth with Robinson and Swift

Since you don't appear to have a kicker right now, adding Younghoe Koo seems like a smart move as he's one of the most consistent fantasy kickers, especially with the Falcons' offense. You should be able to add him directly without dropping anyone.
