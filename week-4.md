### **Current Team Status:**
- **Record:** 1-2 (needs wins!)
- **Current Projected Points:** 80.5
- **Major Issues:** Joe Burrow on IR, Mike Evans doubtful with hamstring injury

---

## **OPTIMAL STARTING LINEUP RECOMMENDATIONS:**

### **üéØ REQUIRED POSITION STARTERS:**

**QB:** **Caleb Williams** (CHI) - *18.2 projected points*

**RB1:** **Bijan Robinson** (ATL) - *19.7 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **AUTO START** - Elite RB1, top-5 fantasy RB
- Week 4: Falcons vs Washington (great matchup)

**RB2:** **D'Andre Swift** (CHI) - *13.1 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **START** - Despite hip injury, he's expected to play

**FLEX1:** **Michael Pittman** (IND) - *13.8 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **START** - Best FLEX option on your bench
- Week 4: Colts @ Rams (decent matchup)
- Higher ceiling than your other options

**FLEX2:** **Nick Chubb** (HOU) - *11.7 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **START** - Solid RB option returning from injury
- Week 4: Texans vs Titans (division rivalry, good matchup)
- Safe floor as your second FLEX

**K:** **Cairo Santos** (CHI) - *6.8 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **START** - Your only kicker, solid option

**DEF:** **CHI Defense** - *6.4 projected points*
- ‚úÖ **START** - Your only defense, decent matchup
- Week 4: Bears @ Raiders (Raiders offense can struggle)

## **üö® PLAYERS TO BENCH:**

**Mike Evans (TB)** - *Doubtful with hamstring injury*
- ‚ùå **DO NOT START** - Not practicing, unlikely to play
- Even if active, hamstring injuries limit performance

**Rhamondre Stevenson (NE)** - *10.4 projected points*
- ‚ùå **BENCH** - Lower ceiling than Chubb/Pittman
- Patriots offense struggling, tough matchup vs Carolina

**Zay Flowers (BAL)** - *13.1 projected points*
- ‚ùå **BENCH** - Good player but lower priority than Pittman
- Ravens @ Chiefs could be a shootout, but Pitts/London are safer starts

**Rashee Rice (KC)** - *Currently starting but should be benched*
- ‚ùå **BENCH** - Lower projection than Pittman/Chubb
- Chiefs vs Ravens is tough, better options available

---

## **üìä PROJECTED IMPACT:**
- **New Projected Total:** ~89.5 points (+9 points improvement)
- **Key Upgrades:** Pittman over Rice, Chubb over Stevenson
- **Risk Management:** Evans injury situation handled conservatively

---

## **‚ö†Ô∏è WEEK 4 MONITORING:**
1. **Tyreek Hill** - Check status for Monday night game
2. **Kyle Pitts** - Monitor toe injury, but expect him to play
3. **D'Andre Swift** - Hip injury, but should be active

This lineup gives you the best chance to compete this week while managing your injury concerns. The key changes are getting Pittman and Chubb into starting roles over Rice and Stevenson, which should provide a higher floor and ceiling for Week 4.
